## Predicting the Onset of Diabetes

### Introduction
Diabetes is a major global health concern, affecting approximately 422 million people worldwide, with significant implications for women's health. The disease is projected to impact 313 million women by 2040, with 2.1 million diabetes-related deaths annually, many of which are premature. Developing a deep learning model for diabetes prediction can aid in early detection, diagnosis, and identifying at-risk individuals, thus improving prevention and management strategies.

### Aim
The project's aim is to build a deep learning model to predict diabetes in female patients based on diagnostic measurements. This focus on women is crucial due to specific gender-related risk factors such as gestational diabetes and a higher risk of diabetic retinopathy and heart disease in women.

### Methodology
The project employs a dataset of female patient diagnostic measurements to train and validate the model. Key steps include:

### Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Feature Scaling: Standardizing features to improve model performance, particularly important for the ANN model used, which incorporates ReLU activation functions in the input and hidden layers, and a Sigmoid activation function in the output layer.
- Model Training: Splitting the data into training and validation sets to train the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Results
The deep learning model demonstrated promising results in classifying diabetic and non-diabetic patients, with potential implications for clinical practices in early detection and intervention strategies.

### Conclusion
The model's ability to predict diabetes specifically in women can lead to targeted interventions and better management of the disease. Addressing the gender gap in clinical studies, this project contributes valuable insights into gender-specific healthcare strategies and highlights the importance of tailored approaches in medical research.

### Future Work
Future enhancements could involve expanding the dataset to include diverse populations and incorporating additional risk factors. Exploring other machine learning models and further tuning the ANN's hyperparameters may also improve prediction accuracy.
